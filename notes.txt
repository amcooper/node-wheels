Roll back to previous commit, and have the router (Express) redirect * to /#/items or whatever.

So it looks like I need to include Angular-UI-Router 1.0.0 to get components going.

Right now I've got 0.3.2[?], loaded in with Browserify.

Two approaches.
1. npm uninstall - zap gateway.js and bundle.js - then install angular ui router 0.3.2 [?] inside the public directory.
2. npm uninstall - zap gateway.js and bundle.js - then install angular ui router 0.3.2 in root directory - and Browserify again.
